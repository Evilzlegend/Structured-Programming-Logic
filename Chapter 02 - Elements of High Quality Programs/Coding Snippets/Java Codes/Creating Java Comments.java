/*
TOPIC SUMMARY
Comments are non-executing statements you include in programs for documentation. You might want
to include the name of the author of a program or the date it was written. You might want to include
descriptions of a program's purpose or explain any parts that a future programmer might find
confusing. When you write business programs, your organization might have specific guidelines as to
what to include in program comments.

TOPIC EXPLANATION
- A Java line comment starts with two slashes and continues to the end of its line.
- A Java block comment starts with a forward slash and a asterisk and continues until there is an 
  asterisk and slash, even if that is several lines later.

PLAYING WITH CODING SNIPPETS:
1. Hit the Run button to see the output in the snippet box.
2. Play around with the snippet code - change variable names, parameters, etc.
3. Hit the Run button again to see what works and what does not work after you manipulate the code.
4. Run the correct code again to compare it to the manipulated code.
5. Have fun practicing this snippet as many times as you like - there are no limits!
