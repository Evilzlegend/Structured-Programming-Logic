# Topic Summary:
# A string is a piece of text that is data in a program. In Python,
# you can use single quotes or double quotes to mark the boundaries
# of a string, so long as you use the same symbol at start and end:
# 'a simple string', "another string"

# TOPIC EXPLANATION:
# Inside a string you can put any text you can type on the keyboard. If the string was written with double-
# quotes, then you may use a single-quote inside the string: "I'm a big fan". Similarily, strings bounded
# with single-quotes may include double-quotes within them: 'He said, "Drat!"'. What if you wanted
# to include both single and double-quotes inside a string? Then you would use the special character \
# to indicate that the quote that follows is not the end of the string: 'I\'ve never said "Rudolph!"'.
# Other usefule special codes include \n to indicate a newline and \\ to indicate that you want the
# backlash in the string.

# PLAY WITH CODING SNIPPETS:
# 1. Hit the Run button to see the output in the snippet box.
# 2. Play around with the snippet code - change variable names, parameters, etc.
# 3. Hit the Run button against to see what works and what does not work after
# you manipulate the code.
# 4. Run the correct code again to compare it to the manipulated code.
# 5. Have fun practicing this snippet as many times as you like - there are no limits!
