# TOPIC SUMMARY:
# Variables, functions, types, and even program filenames are all examples of named things in Python.
# Names must be easy for Python to recognize; therefore there are rules about what a vlid name is. You
# must follow these when defining variables or functions; you should follow them when naming your
# code files, or when creating classes.

#TOPIC EXPLANATION:
#Naming rules:

# Names may not contain spaces.
# Names must start with either an alphabetic character or the underscore character _ .
# Names may only contain alphabetic characters, numberic characters, or underscores.

# PLAY WITH CODING SNIPPETS:
# 1. Hit the Run button to see the output in the snippet box.
# 2. Play around with the snippet code - change variable names, parameters, etc.
# 3. Hit the Run button again to see what works and what does not work after you manipulate the code.
# 4. Run the correct code again to compare it to the manipulated code.
# 5. Have fun practicing this snippet as many times as you like - there are no limits!
