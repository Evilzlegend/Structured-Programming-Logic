# TOPIC SUMMARY:
# In Python, the two most common types of numbers are integers (int) and floating-point, real-valued
# numbers (float). Integers may be positive or negative, and are written without a decimal point. Real
# numbers are written with a decimal point, and may be in Python's form of scientific notation.
